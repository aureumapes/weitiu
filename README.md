# Weitiu
### Host your own Document sharing site

## How to use
Just run `make install`

Run the tool simply via the cli: `weitiu`, it should be located in /usr/bin/

To change your admin password type `passwd` when running it, to start the server type `start`

The admin password can be used to upload new entries to the database, they can be deleted and modified via the sqlite-cli tool, I may add this features to the app itself soon.
